# Dice Challenge Game

The Dicee Game is a simple web-based game that simulates a dice roll for two players. The players' dice images are randomly generated each time the page is refreshed, and the winner is determined based on the higher dice roll.

## Features

- **Random Dice Roll**: The game uses JavaScript to generate random dice images for two players.
- **Winner Identification**: The player with the higher dice roll is declared the winner.
- **Interactive UI**: The game provides a visually appealing and interactive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **GitHub Link**: The project includes a link to the developer's GitHub profile in the footer.

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.
2. Click the "Refresh Me" button or refresh the page to roll the dice and determine the winner.
